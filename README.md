# Hacking Software Simulation

## Description

This is a text-based hacking simulation designed for entertainment purposes, especially suitable for younger children and kids. Please note that this simulation doesn't perform any real hacking and is purely for fun.

## Getting Started

You can run the simulation by executing the `main.py` script. It's a standalone Python program, so no special setup or prerequisites are required.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

Once you run the simulation, you'll be immersed in a fictional hacking scenario with text-based visuals. Interact with the simulation and enjoy the experience. It's a safe and playful introduction to the world of computer security.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to make the simulation even more enjoyable for users, especially kids. Here are some ways you can contribute:

- Visual Enhancements: Add colorful text, ASCII art, or graphical elements to make the simulation visually engaging.

- Sound Effects: Incorporate sound effects to create an immersive atmosphere.

- Interactive Elements:Make the simulation more interactive to captivate the audience.
